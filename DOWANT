THINGS WE WANT (feel free to add):


Laundry list of needed tools:

FFT

Least-squares fitting (imagined usage: graph <{lsf data} <{cat data} | plot)
	That Useless Use of Cat is a problem with rc, not me.

Statistical distribution programs - chi-square, poisson, gaussian

Multiplication program (able to work on any kind of input, see first TODO item
	below)

Normalization programs

To/From CSV files, or just ``Delimited files'' -- there's already a program for
	this, called Awk, but a wrapper around it or something small in C might
	be worth doing instead to clarify semantics and save typing

===============================================================================

TODOS:

Make everything use the lexer so that matrices, vectors, scalars all have
meaningful input to every program unless it's absolutely impossible for
them to have meaning. e.g., a multiplier program should check its inputs
to see if it gets 2 matrices, 2 vectors, 2 scalars, vector and matrix, matrix
and scalar, vector and scalar and do the right thing in *every* case.

Programs need to handle more than just standard input, but also files. See
the Plan 9 cat.c source code file for the perfect implementation: make for
example the main() routine in sd.c a function taking a FILE* and have main
just loop over every argument opening that file and calling the routine, else
giving the routine stdin as an open file.

Programs probably need comments, better efficiency, more elegance -- I'm not
rob or ken.

===============================================================================

Useful tools that should be mentioned in a Readme:

Plan 9 graph, plot, factor, primes, seq, rc, hoc...
paste
Moreutils, particularly vipe for editing pipes and pee for enhanced tee
gnuplot, plotutils
